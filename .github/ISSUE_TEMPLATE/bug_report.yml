        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in this adapter!**

        If this is the first time you are doing this, please take a few moments to read
        through the [README](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.javascript/blob/master/README.md).

        You are about to report a bug in **JavaScript Adapter**. Do not proceed if your issue
        occurs with ioBroker core, any other adapters, unofficial or outdated
        adapter or NodeJS versions.

        Do also not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a
        question ...", "Can someone walk me through ..."), that belongs into the
        [ioBroker forum at forum.iobroker.net](https://forum.iobroker.net/).

        Thank you for your collaboration!
